# AdvancedAccelerator: Enhanced Transformer Accelerator

## Overview

The `AdvancedAccelerator` is an enhanced accelerator designed to improve the efficiency and performance of transformer-based models. It incorporates advanced features such as dropout, residual connections, and layer-wise normalization to enhance the robustness and generalization of the accelerator.

## Features

- Initial feature transformation with linear layers.
- Multi-Head Self Attention mechanism with dropout for regularization.
- Feedforward layer with dropout and ReLU activation.
- Layer normalization after each linear layer for stability.
- Residual connections with a learnable scaling factor.
- Configurable dropout rate and other hyperparameters.

## Usage

```python
from advancedNeural import AdvancedAccelerator

# Instantiate the accelerator
accelerator = AdvancedAccelerator(input_size, output_size, hidden_size=256, dropout_rate=0.1)

# Forward pass
output = accelerator(input_data)

```
Please check the usage.md file

# Parameters

- input_size: Input dimensionality of the data.
- output_size: Output dimensionality of the accelerator.
- hidden_size: Dimensionality of the hidden layer (default: 256).
- dropout_rate: Dropout rate for regularization (default: 0.1).

```python
# Example instantiation
accelerator = AdvancedAccelerator(input_size=512, output_size=256, hidden_size=128, dropout_rate=0.2)

# Forward pass with sample input
output = accelerator(torch.randn(32, 512))
```
