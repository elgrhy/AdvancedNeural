# AdvancedAccelerator Usage Guide

## Introduction

The `AdvancedAccelerator` is a lightweight and efficient accelerator designed to enhance the performance of transformer-based neural network models, particularly large language models (LLMs). It incorporates advanced features such as dropout, residual connections, layer-wise normalization, and adaptive activation functions to improve the robustness, generalization, and adaptability of the accelerator to various transformer architectures.

## Installation

### Using pip

The recommended installation method is using the `pip` package manager. Follow these steps to install the `advancedNeural` package:

```bash
pip install advancedNeural
```

### Alternative Installation Methods

If you encounter difficulties with `pip` installation, consider alternative methods:

* **Manual Installation:** Download the source code from a repository like GitHub, extract the files, and follow the installation instructions.

* **Pre-built Binaries:** Check for pre-built binaries or wheels for the `advancedNeural` package and install them directly.

* **Containerized Environment:** Use a containerized environment like Docker to isolate the package and dependencies.

* **Virtual Environment:** Create a virtual environment to isolate the package and dependencies from other Python installations.

* **Alternative Package Managers:** Consider using alternative package managers like `conda` or `easy_install`.

* **Community Support:** Seek assistance from the `advancedNeural` community or online resources for specific installation issues.

## Usage

### Importing the Accelerator

```python
from advancedNeural import AdvancedAccelerator
```

### Instantiating the Accelerator

```python
input_size = ...  # Size of the input data
output_size = ...  # Size of the output data
hidden_size = 256  # Size of the hidden layer
dropout_rate = 0.1  # Dropout rate

accelerator = AdvancedAccelerator(input_size, output_size, hidden_size, dropout_rate)
```

### Forward Pass

```python
input_data = ...  # Your input data

output = accelerator(input_data)
```

## Example Usage

```python
import torch
from advancedNeural import AdvancedAccelerator

# Define input data and labels
input_data = torch.randn(32, 100)  # Input data with 32 samples and 100 features
labels = torch.randint(0, 2, (32,))  # Labels with 32 samples

# Instantiate the accelerator
accelerator = AdvancedAccelerator(100, 2, hidden_size=64, dropout_rate=0.2)

# Train the accelerator
for epoch in range(10):
    output = accelerator(input_data)
    loss = torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy(output, labels)
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

# Evaluate the accelerator
output = accelerator(input_data)
predictions = torch.argmax(output, dim=1)
accuracy = torch.mean(predictions == labels)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues using the `AdvancedAccelerator`, consider these troubleshooting steps:

* **Check Installation:** Verify that the `advancedNeural` package is properly installed and accessible.

* **Data Compatibility:** Ensure that the input data format and dimensions are compatible with the accelerator's expectations.

* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Adjust hyperparameters like `hidden_size` and `dropout_rate` to optimize performance.

* **Error Messages:** Carefully analyze error messages to identify the source of the issue.

* **Community Support:** Seek assistance from the `advancedNeural` community or online resources for specific troubleshooting.
